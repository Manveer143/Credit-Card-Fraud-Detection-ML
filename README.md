# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction
This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud, aiming to enhance the speed and real-time responsiveness of fraud detection systems compared to conventional techniques. This helps minimize financial losses and productivity waste. Credit card fraud remains a critical problem, evolving with technology to include skimming, phishing, and identity theft, costing the financial industry billions annually. Traditional fraud detection methods often rely on manual analysis or rule-based systems, which are slow, inefficient, and unable to adapt to new fraud patterns in real-time.

## Study Objectives
1.  Analyze banking credit card datasets using logistic regression.
2.  Analyze banking credit card datasets using random forest.
3.  Analyze banking credit card datasets using decision trees.
4.  Analyze banking credit card datasets using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
5.  Compare the performance of these machine learning techniques.

## Study Questions

1.  How can banking credit card datasets be effectively analyzed using logistic regression for fraud detection?
2.  How can banking credit card datasets be analyzed using random forest to identify fraudulent transactions?
3.  How can banking credit card datasets be analyzed using decision trees to detect fraud patterns?
4.  How can banking credit card datasets be analyzed using RFM to detect anomalies indicative of fraud?
5.  How do the performances of logistic regression, random forest, decision trees, and RFM compare in the context of credit card fraud detection?

## Hypotheses

*   **H1**: Logistic regression can accurately classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on transaction features.
*   **H2**: Random Forest will outperform Logistic Regression and Decision Trees in fraud detection due to its ensemble nature and ability to handle complex data patterns.
*   **H3**: Decision Trees can provide interpretable rules for identifying fraudulent transactions, but may be less accurate than Random Forest.

7.  **Conclusions**: Drawing conclusions based on the analysis.

### Analysis Techniques
*   Logistic Regression
*   Random Forest
*   Decision Tree
*   Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM)

### Justification of Analysis Techniques
*   **Logistic Regression (LR)**: A statistical model that predicts the probability of fraud based on input features, serving as a baseline model.
*   **Random Forest (RF)**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting, capable of capturing complex patterns.
*   **Decision Tree (DT)**: A tree-like model that makes decisions based on feature values, easy to interpret and visualize for understanding key fraud indicators.
*   **Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Analysis**: A marketing technique used to identify valuable customers, adapted here to detect unusual spending behavior by analyzing transaction history.

### Ethical Procedures

1.  **Data Privacy**: Anonymizing all sensitive data to protect customer identities and comply with data protection regulations.
2.  **Bias Mitigation**: Ensuring that the machine learning models are free from biases that could unfairly target specific groups of customers.
3.  **Transparency**: Providing clear explanations of how the fraud detection systems work and how decisions are made.
4.  **Fairness**: Regularly monitoring and evaluating the systems to ensure that they are fair and do not discriminate against any individuals.
5.  **Accountability**: Establishing clear lines of responsibility for the development, deployment, and monitoring of the fraud detection systems.
